            <p>
                <br>
                Welcome to my page! My name is Mia and this is my testimony.
                <br><br>

                Before I decided to dedicate myself to this new lifestyle I was facing many trials and tribulations in
                my personal life. I was healing from the lost of my father and I was an unemployed recent college grad and
                had no clue as to what I wanted to do with my life. The transition from college to the real world was
                extremely hard. On top of that, I was overweight and unhappy with myself. I found myself eating my
                emotions but that only made me feel good temporarily. One day, I looked at myself in the mirror and I
                didn't know who I was anymore and that's when I knew I needed to make a change. Self awareness is the
                first step to betterment.
                <br><br>

                I started my journey as a spiritual journey. For 40 days straight I wrote to God and meditated. I prayed
                for strength and guidance as I began this new journey. I detoxed my mind and body. I changed my diet. I
                exercised more. I studied health and wellness. 40 days later I realized I went from 230 pounds to 190
                pounds! Through prayer, faith and dedication I was able to not only lose weight but I found inner
                strength I never knew I had. I found joy and peace within. I automatically knew I wanted to help others
                revitalize their lives. Out of pain came my purpose. My ultimate goal is to help others live healthier
                lives mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually.
                <br><br>

                So, if this sounds like YOU, please allow me to assist you in reviving, restoring and renewing your
                LIFE!
